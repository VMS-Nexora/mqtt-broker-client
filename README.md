# Custom DBMS Deployment

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) using [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/), an open-source backend solution. The setup is designed to be deployed on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or your local machine for personal or development use.

## Features

- **PocketBase Integration**: Utilizes PocketBase for a lightweight, easy-to-use backend.
- **Custom DBMS**: Tailored database schema and logic to fit specific needs.
- **VPS Deployment**: Ready for deployment on a VPS or local PC.
- **API Access**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for database interactions.
- **Authentication**: Built-in user authentication and management.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (for building PocketBase from source, if necessary)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (optional, for containerized deployment)
- A VPS or local machine with a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu)
